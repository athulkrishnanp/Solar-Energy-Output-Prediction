Solar Energy Output Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts **solar energy output** using a **Random Forest Regressor**. This model helps estimate solar power generation based on weather and environmental factors, enabling better planning, efficiency improvement, and smarter energy management.

Features

* Predicts solar PV output using historical and real-time weather data
* Built using **RandomForestRegressor** for stable and accurate results
* Handles nonlinear patterns effectively
* Includes performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, R² Score)
* Easy to integrate into dashboards or web applications (Django/Flask)

Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas & NumPy** – Data processing
* **Scikit-learn** – ML model (RandomForestRegressor)
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn** – Visualizations
* **Django


 Future Improvements

* Try XGBoost or Gradient Boosting for higher accuracy
* Add live weather API inputs
* Deploy as a cloud-based prediction service
